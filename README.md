- ## Description
This game was made during my 3nd year in Epitech Réunion at Réunion Island for a Volcano Game Jam.
The game was made with Unity and the assets are royalty-free.
In the repository you'll find all the source code and assets, which you can reuse free of charge.

- ## Prerequisites
- Unity 2021.3.14f1 or higher
- Visual studio or any IDE with .NET
- Windows operating system

- ## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/Shino974/Unum-Sanitatis.git
  - Add the project with Unity 
  - Start the project (for debug mode) or go to file -> Build and run (for an .exe)

- ## Usage
You can move around with the arrow keys.
The game is not yet finished, but the first level is available.
So there's no end to the game.
